                        <p>
                            As a <strong>System Engineer</strong> and <strong>IT Consultant</strong>, I make it a
                            priority to work hands-on with the technologies I recommend. This homelab is my way of
                            keeping skills sharp, testing new ideas, and ensuring I can deliver reliable solutions in
                            real-world situations.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is built to reflect professional infrastructure standards, with a focus on scalability,
                            uptime, and security. Every component is there for a reason and is managed as if it were
                            running in a live production environment.
                        </p>

                <h2>> Core Infrastructure: Proxmox VE Cluster</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>High Availability (HA) to keep services online</li>
                        <li>Live migration between nodes for maintenance and upgrades</li>
                        <li>Centralized cluster management</li>
                        <li>ZFS-backed storage for speed and data protection</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        This cluster setup makes it possible to run complex workloads and test advanced scenarios such
                        as
                        rolling upgrades, service migrations, and load balancing.
                    </p>

                    <h2>> Storage: Dual TrueNAS SCALE NAS Servers</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Two TrueNAS SCALE systems for redundancy and scalability</li>
                            <li>ZFS-based storage with snapshots and replication</li>
                            <li>Separate storage pools for different workloads</li>
                            <li>Integration with Proxmox VE for shared storage</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            By using two TrueNAS SCALE servers, I can replicate data between sites and maintain
                            consistent,
                            high-performance storage for all virtual machines and containers.

                            <p>
                                My backup strategy uses both <strong>on-site</strong> and <strong>remote Proxmox Backup
                                    Servers</strong> for secure, deduplicated, and encrypted backups.
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Disaster recovery across different locations</li>
                                <li>Fast incremental restores</li>
                                <li>Snapshot-based backups for virtual machines and containers</li>
                            </ul>

                                    <li>MikroTik routers and switches for reliable, flexible networking</li>
                                    <li>Reverse proxy with HTTPS</li>
                                    <li>Identity-based authentication via a self-hosted IdP</li>
                                    <li>Network segmentation with VLANs and firewalls</li>
                                    <li>Site-to-site VPN for secure remote access</li>
                                    <li>Continuous monitoring and alerting</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>
                                    Security is part of the design from the ground up, ensuring every service and device
                                    is protected.
