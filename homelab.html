                            This is where I break things on purpose. I use my homelab to test ideas, try out
                            tools before recommending them, and generally mess around with infrastructure in
                            ways I can't do at work. It's overkill for home use, but that's the point.
                        </p>

                    </div>
                </div>

                <h2>Compute</h2>
                <p>
                    Everything runs on a <strong>Proxmox VE</strong> cluster. High availability, live migration
                    between nodes, ZFS for storage. I can take a node offline for maintenance without anything
                    going down.
                </p>

                <h2>Storage</h2>
                <p>
                    Two <strong>TrueNAS SCALE</strong> boxes with ZFS. Snapshots, replication, separate pools
                    for different workloads. They feed into Proxmox as shared storage.
                </p>

                <h2>Backups</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Proxmox Backup Server</strong> running both on-site and at a remote location.
                    Deduplicated, encrypted, incremental. If something goes wrong I can restore VMs and
                    containers quickly.
                </p>

                <h2>Networking</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>MikroTik</strong> gear for routing and switching. VLANs to segment traffic,
                    firewall rules between zones. Remote access through <strong>NetBird</strong> (Zero Trust)
                    and site-to-site VPN. Reverse proxy with HTTPS for anything exposed. Self-hosted identity
                    provider for SSO.
                </p>

                <h2>Services</h2>
                <p>Some of the stuff I run:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Nextcloud</strong> for files, calendar, contacts</li>
                    <li><strong>Jellyfin</strong> for media</li>
                    <li><strong>Vaultwarden</strong> for passwords</li>
                    <li><strong>Pocket ID</strong> for SSO</li>
                    <li><strong>Home Assistant</strong> for home automation</li>
                    <li><strong>Immich</strong> for photo backups</li>
                    <li><strong>Servarr stack</strong> for media management</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Why bother</h2>
                <p>
                    Mostly because I enjoy it. But it's also useful. I get to test things before suggesting
                    them to clients, practice disaster recovery when nothing is actually on fire, and figure
                    out what works and what doesn't without any pressure.
                </p>
