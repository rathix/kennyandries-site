                        <p>
                            As a <strong>System Engineer and IT Consultant</strong>, I believe deeply in mastering the
                            technologies
                            I recommend. That's why I've built and maintain a production-grade homelab that mirrors the
                            standards,
                            scalability, and resilience expected in professional environments.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This infrastructure is more than just a playground - it's a self-hosted, continuously
                            evolving
                            platform
                            where I design, deploy, and maintain real services with enterprise-grade principles.
                        </p>

                            alt="Self-hosted Proxmox homelab setup with services like Nextcloud and Home Assistant"

                    </div>

                <h3>> Core Stack: Proxmox VE Cluster</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>High Availability (HA)</li>
                    <li>Live Migration</li>
                    <li>Centralized Management</li>
                    <li>ZFS-backed storage</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This setup allows me to simulate and manage real infrastructure scenarios, including rolling
                    upgrades,
                    service migrations, and performance optimization.
                </p>

                <h3>> Resilient Backup Strategy</h3>
                <p>
                    I've implemented both <strong>on-site and remote Proxmox Backup Servers</strong>, providing secure,
                    deduplicated, and encrypted backups across my environment.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Disaster recovery across physical locations</li>
                    <li>Fast, incremental restores</li>
                    <li>Snapshot-based protection for VMs and containers</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>> Actively Managed Services</h3>
                <p>My homelab runs a suite of interconnected, production-grade applications, all self-hosted:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Nextcloud</strong> - Private file storage, calendar, and contact syncing</li>
                    <li><strong>Jellyfin</strong> - Media server for streaming content locally and remotely</li>
                    <li><strong>Vaultwarden</strong> - Self-hosted password management (Bitwarden-compatible)</li>
                    <li><strong>Pocket ID</strong> - Self-hosted identity provider for SSO across services</li>
                    <li><strong>Home Assistant</strong> - Full-stack smart home automation and control</li>
                    <li><strong>Immich</strong> - AI-based photo backup and management</li>
                    <li><strong>Servarr Stack</strong> - Media acquisition automation (Sonarr, Radarr, Lidarr, etc.)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    These services are reverse proxied, monitored, and secured as they would be in production,
                    demonstrating
                    my end-to-end understanding of deployment, orchestration, and lifecycle management.
                </p>

                <h3>> Network & Security Architecture</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reverse proxy with HTTPS and strict access control</li>
                    <li>Identity-based authentication (via my own IdP)</li>
                    <li>Internal network segmentation and firewall policies</li>
                    <li>Site-to-site VPN for remote access and replication</li>
                    <li>Real-time monitoring and alerting</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Security is treated as a first-class citizen in every layer of the stack.</p>

                <h3>> Why This Matters</h3>
                <p>My homelab is a reflection of how I work in production environments:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I <strong>prototype fast</strong>, iterate safely, and deploy with confidence.</li>
                    <li>I maintain <strong>high availability and backups</strong> as a default, not an afterthought.
                    </li>
                    <li>I understand <strong>self-hosted alternatives</strong> and where they can replace or supplement
                        SaaS.</li>
                    <li>I evaluate and implement open-source tools with a focus on long-term maintainability and
                        security.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>> Let's Work Together</h3>
                <p>
                    Whether you're a company looking to modernize legacy systems, optimize infrastructure, or improve
                    resilience and security - I bring proven, practical experience from both the field and my own
                    infrastructure.
