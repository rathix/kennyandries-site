                        </header>

                        <section>
                            <p>
                                The mobile fleet had grown into a patchwork of 20,000 COPE and BYOD devices
                                spread across rail operations, dispatching centers, workshops, and corporate
                                offices. Policies varied between teams, security baselines were inconsistent,
                                and provisioning a single device took well over 40 minutes of hands-on work.
                                With NIS2 and ISO 27001 compliance deadlines approaching, the organization
                                needed a ground-up rethink of its mobile device strategy.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I led the architecture and rollout, working closely with security, operations,
                                and external vendors to land on enrollment models that actually fit each user
                                group rather than forcing everyone into the same mold.
                            </p>

                            <h2>Enrollment strategy</h2>
                            <p>
                                Different roles have fundamentally different needs, so we designed four
                                enrollment tracks instead of one:
                            </p>

                            <h2>Security hardening</h2>
                            <p>
                                We built a unified set of security baselines through Intune and Knox Service
                                Plugin, mapped to NIS2 and ISO 27001 controls. Device compliance policies,
                                configuration profiles, conditional access rules, and app protection policies
                                were standardized across the entire fleet. Devices that drifted out of
                                compliance got flagged automatically and blocked from corporate resources
                                until remediated. No more one-off exceptions or shadow configurations that
                                quietly fell through the cracks.
                            </p>

                            <h2>Defender for Endpoint</h2>
                            <p>
                                Rolled out Microsoft Defender for Endpoint across all managed devices.
                                Threat detection, EDR capabilities, and vulnerability management all
                                integrated into the Intune stack. Combined with risk-based conditional
                                access, a device that picks up a threat gets its access revoked in near
                                real-time without waiting on a helpdesk ticket.
                            </p>

                            <h2>Provisioning &amp; delivery</h2>
                            <p>
                                Onboarding was one of the biggest pain points. The old process involved
                                manual configuration, multiple handoffs, and well over 40 minutes of
                                hands-on time per device for the end user. We replaced it with fully
                                automated provisioning through Intune staging profiles coordinated with
                                external logistics vendors. Devices now ship pre-configured and ready to
                                use out of the box. White glove delivery handles the edge cases. User
                                setup time dropped to under 5 minutes.
                            </p>

                            <h2>Knox migration &amp; fleet intelligence</h2>
                            <p>
                                The Samsung devices were managed through Knox Configure, which had its own
                                licensing model and lifecycle separate from Intune. We migrated everything
                                to Knox Service Plugin, consolidating Samsung-specific policies into the
                                same Intune management plane as the rest of the fleet. On top of that, we
                                rolled out E-FOTA (Enterprise Firmware Over The Air) for controlled OS
                                updates across the Samsung fleet, and Knox Asset Intelligence (KAI) for
                                real-time battery health monitoring, app usage analytics, and device
                                lifecycle insights.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Alongside the technical migration, we audited the full device lifecycle
                                from procurement to retirement, cleaned up unused licenses, and eliminated
                                redundant tooling. Net result: more than &euro;200k in annual savings.
                            </p>

                            <h2>Process overhaul</h2>
                            <p>
                                The technology changes only work if the processes around them change too.
                                We reworked the end-to-end mobile device lifecycle: how devices get
                                requested, approved, provisioned, shipped, swapped, repaired, and retired.
                                Helpdesk workflows were redesigned, escalation paths clarified, and
                                documentation rewritten so that frontline support could handle the most
                                common scenarios without escalation. Vendor coordination for logistics,
                                repairs, and returns was streamlined into defined SLAs with clear
                                handoff points.
                            </p>
