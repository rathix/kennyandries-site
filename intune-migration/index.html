                    The existing mobile fleet was a patchwork of COPE and BYOD enrollments that had
                    grown organically over the years. Different teams ran different policies, security
                    baselines varied wildly, and onboarding a single device took nearly 40 minutes of
                    manual work. With NIS2 and ISO 27001 compliance deadlines approaching, the
                    organization needed a complete overhaul of its mobile device strategy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I owned the end-to-end redesign: from enrollment architecture and security
                    baselines to provisioning automation and vendor coordination. A fleet of 20,000
                    devices across rail operations, dispatching, workshops, and corporate offices,
                    each user group getting the management model that matched their actual workflow
                    instead of a one-size-fits-all policy.

                                <strong>COSU</strong> for single-purpose devices in workshops, realtime
                                dispatching centers, and as urgent swap devices for train managers and
                                drivers. Locked to specific apps, no user interaction needed beyond the
                                task at hand. <strong>COBO</strong> for operational staff who need a
                                fully managed corporate device. <strong>COPE</strong> for white collar
                                workers who get a work profile alongside personal use. <strong>MAM</strong>
                                for scenarios where app-level protection and conditional access are enough
                                without enrolling the device itself.

                                fleet: device compliance rules, configuration profiles, conditional
                                access policies, and app protection. No more exceptions or one-off
                                configurations drifting out of compliance.

                                glass. Devices that fall out of compliance get flagged and blocked
                                automatically.
