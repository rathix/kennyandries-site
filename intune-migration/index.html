                <p>
                    The mobile fleet had grown into a patchwork of 20,000 COPE and BYOD devices
                    spread across rail operations, dispatching centers, workshops, and corporate
                    offices. Policies varied between teams, security baselines were inconsistent,
                    and provisioning a single device took well over 40 minutes of hands-on work.
                    With NIS2 and ISO 27001 compliance deadlines approaching, the organization
                    needed a ground-up rethink of its mobile device strategy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I led the architecture and rollout, working closely with security, operations,
                    and external vendors to land on enrollment models that actually fit each user
                    group rather than forcing everyone into the same mold.
                </p>

                <h2>Enrollment strategy</h2>
                <p>
                    Different roles have fundamentally different needs, so we designed four
                    enrollment tracks instead of one:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>COSU</strong> &mdash; single-purpose, kiosk-style devices locked to
                        a specific set of apps. Used in workshops for maintenance tooling, in
                        realtime dispatching centers for traffic control, and as urgent swap
                        devices that train managers and drivers can grab and go when their
                        primary device fails.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>COBO</strong> &mdash; fully managed corporate devices for
                        operational staff. Complete control over the device, no personal use.
                        Hardened baselines enforced from enrollment.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>COPE</strong> &mdash; corporate-owned devices with a personal
                        profile for white collar workers. Work data stays containerized and
                        policy-managed while users keep a personal side for their own apps.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>MAM</strong> &mdash; app-level protection without device
                        enrollment. Conditional access and data loss prevention policies applied
                        directly to managed apps for users on personal devices who only need
                        access to email, Teams, or a handful of corporate apps.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Security hardening</h2>
                <p>
                    We built a unified set of security baselines through Intune and Knox Service
                    Plugin, mapped to NIS2 and ISO 27001 controls. Device compliance policies,
                    configuration profiles, conditional access rules, and app protection policies
                    were standardized across the entire fleet. Devices that drifted out of
                    compliance got flagged automatically and blocked from corporate resources
                    until remediated. No more one-off exceptions or shadow configurations that
                    quietly fell through the cracks.
                </p>

                <h2>Defender for Endpoint</h2>
                <p>
                    Rolled out Microsoft Defender for Endpoint across all managed devices.
                    Threat detection, EDR capabilities, and vulnerability management all
                    integrated into the Intune stack. Combined with risk-based conditional
                    access, a device that picks up a threat gets its access revoked in near
                    real-time without waiting on a helpdesk ticket.
                </p>

                <h2>Provisioning &amp; delivery</h2>
                <p>
                    Onboarding was one of the biggest pain points. The old process involved
                    manual configuration, multiple handoffs, and well over 40 minutes of
                    hands-on time per device for the end user. We replaced it with fully
                    automated provisioning through Intune staging profiles coordinated with
                    external logistics vendors. Devices now ship pre-configured and ready to
                    use out of the box. White glove delivery handles the edge cases. User
                    setup time dropped to under 5 minutes.
                </p>

                <h2>Knox migration &amp; fleet intelligence</h2>
                <p>
                    The Samsung devices were managed through Knox Configure, which had its own
                    licensing model and lifecycle separate from Intune. We migrated everything
                    to Knox Service Plugin, consolidating Samsung-specific policies into the
                    same Intune management plane as the rest of the fleet. On top of that, we
                    rolled out E-FOTA (Enterprise Firmware Over The Air) for controlled OS
                    updates across the Samsung fleet, and Knox Asset Intelligence (KAI) for
                    real-time battery health monitoring, app usage analytics, and device
                    lifecycle insights.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alongside the technical migration, we audited the full device lifecycle
                    from procurement to retirement, cleaned up unused licenses, and eliminated
                    redundant tooling. Net result: more than &euro;200k in annual savings.
                </p>

                <h2>Process overhaul</h2>
                <p>
                    The technology changes only work if the processes around them change too.
                    We reworked the end-to-end mobile device lifecycle: how devices get
                    requested, approved, provisioned, shipped, swapped, repaired, and retired.
                    Helpdesk workflows were redesigned, escalation paths clarified, and
                    documentation rewritten so that frontline support could handle the most
                    common scenarios without escalation. Vendor coordination for logistics,
                    repairs, and returns was streamlined into defined SLAs with clear
                    handoff points.
                </p>

                <h2>Impact</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>20,000 devices</strong> migrated across COSU, COBO, COPE, and MAM</li>
                    <li><strong>NIS2 and ISO 27001</strong> compliance through enforced, auditable baselines</li>
                    <li><strong>Defender for Endpoint</strong> deployed fleet-wide with risk-based conditional access</li>
                    <li><strong>User setup under 5 minutes</strong> &mdash; down from well over 40</li>
                    <li><strong>Zero-touch provisioning</strong> through staging profiles and vendor coordination</li>
                    <li><strong>Knox Configure to KSP</strong> migration with E-FOTA and KAI fleet-wide</li>
                    <li><strong>Lifecycle processes</strong> overhauled from request through retirement</li>
                    <li><strong>&euro;200k+ annual savings</strong> from license and tooling consolidation</li>
                </ul>
